// Backend (Node.js and Express.js)
// 1. Concurrency
// Concurrency refers to the ability to handle multiple tasks at the same time. In Node.js, this is achieved using the event loop and asynchronous I/O operations.

// 2. Does Concurrency Need Multiple Threads?
// Concurrency does not necessarily require multiple threads. Node.js handles concurrency using a single-threaded event loop that can manage multiple I/O operations concurrently.

// 3. HTTP Status Codes
// 201 Created: Indicates that the request has been fulfilled and has resulted in one or more new resources being created.

// 403 Forbidden: Indicates that the server understands the request but refuses to authorize it.

// 400 Bad Request: Indicates that the server cannot or will not process the request due to a client error (e.g., malformed request syntax).

// 4. Reverse Proxy
// A reverse proxy is a server that sits between client devices and backend servers, forwarding client requests to the backend servers. It can provide load balancing, caching, and additional security.

// Example with Nginx as a reverse proxy for Node.js:

// nginx
// Copy code
// server {
//   listen 80;

//   server_name your_domain.com;

//   location / {
//     proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
//     proxy_http_version 1.1;
//     proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
//     proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
//     proxy_set_header Host $host;
//     proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
//   }
// }
