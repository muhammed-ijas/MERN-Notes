== What is Mongo DB?

    Mongo DB is an open-source NoSQL database management program 


== How does Mongo DB work?

    MongoDB is a NoSQL , document oriented database management system that stores data as JSON-like documents. it is flexible and scalable. It uses a dynamic schema, allowing for changes in the document and structure to be made without affecting all other documents in the collection. 


== Where is MongoDB used?

    MongoDB is used as a backend database in web applications.
    MongoDB uses Mozilla's SpiderMonkey javascript engine.


==What is Relational DB?

.Relational DB stores data in tables with rows and columns
    .Tables link together using unique identifiers (keys) to show relationships
    .This structure keeps data organized, consistent, and easy to query
    .Common in many applications, uses SQL for data manipulation 


==What is Non-relational DB?

    .Stores data flexibly, not in strict tables like relational database
    .Uses various structures like documents, graphs, or key-value pairs
    .More scalable for big data and handles unstructured data well
    .Examples: MongoDB , Couchbase , Cassandra


==What is Mongoose?

    .Mongoose: An Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for Node.js that simplifies interacting with MongoDB databases.
    .Schema-based: Defines data structure and enforces validation for your MongoDB data.
    .CRUD operations: Handles Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations efficiently.
    .Node.js integration: Makes working with MongoDB from Node.js applications easier.


==Collection

    .A collection is a grouping of MongoDB documents
    .Documents within a collection can have different structures


==Documents

    .Documents are the fundamental unit of data storage in MongoDB.
    .Each document is like a record, organized as key-value pairs (fields and values) similar to JSON objects.
    .Documents within a collection can have different structures, allowing for flexibility in data storage.
    .While structures can vary, documents in a collection often share some common fields for related data.


==JSON

    JSON is a data format that represents the values of objects, arrays, numbers,strings,booleans,and nulls.

    Example:

        {"name": "Alice",
        "age": 30,
        "city": "New York",
        "occupation": "Software Engineer",
        "hobbies": ["reading", "hiking", "coding"]}

    JSON.stringify()  >>>  This method is used to convert a Javascript object or value in to a JSON string.it takes the object as an argument and returns the JSON representation as a string.

    JSON.parse()   >>> This method is used to parse a JSON string and convert it into a javascript object or value. it takes the JSON string as an argument and returns the corresponding Jvascript object . 
    

==BSON

    MongoDB stores documents (objects) in a format called BSON.
    The reason why BSON is used is, BSON supports supports many more data types than JSON. 
    BSON is a binary format, making it more efficient for storage and network transmission compared to text-based JSON. 


==Extended JSON

    Extended JSON is used to represent BSON data types.


==CRUD

    CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete. The fundamental operations for managing data in a database.

    Create >> 
        Inserting a single Document:
            db.collectionName.insertOne({ name: "Alice", age: 30 })

        Insert multiple Documents :
            db.collectionName.insertMany([
                { name: "Bob", age: 25 },
                { name: "Charlie", age: 40 }
            ])

    Read >>
        Find all documents:
            db.collectionName.find({})

        Find documents with specific criteria :
            db.collectionName.find({ age: { $gt: 25 } })

        Find first Document:
            db.collectionName.findOne({ name: "Alice" })

    Update >>
        Update a single Document:
            db.collectionName.updateOne({ name: "Alice" }, { $set: { age: 31 } })
        
        Update multiple Documents:
            db.collectionName.updateMany({ age: { $lt: 30 } }, { $inc: { age: 1 } })

    Delete >>
        Delete a single Document:
            db.collectionName.deleteOne({ name: "Bob" })

        Delete multiple Documents:
            db.collectionName.deleteMany({ age: 40 })   

    ..# Replace collectionName with the actual name of your collection.


==Comparison Operators

    Equality:
        $eq >> Checks for exact equality between a field and a value
            { age: { $eq: 30 } } finds documents where the "age" field is equal to 30

    Inequality:
        $gt >> Greater than 
            { quantity: { $gt: 10 } } finds documents where the "quantity" field is greater than 10.
        $gte >> Greater than or equal to
            { price: { $gte: 25.99 } } finds documents where the "price" field is greater than or equal to 25.99.
        $lt >> Less than
        $lte >> Less than or equal to
    
    Membership:
        $in >> checks if a field value exists within a specified array of values
            { category: { $in: ["books", "movies"] } } finds documents where the "category" field is either "books" or "movies".
        $nin >> Checks if a field's value does not exist within a specified array of values (NOT IN)
            { size: { $nin: ["small", "medium"] } } finds documents where the "size" field is not "small" or "medium".

    Regular Expression:
        $regex >> Performs regular expression pattern matching on string fields.
            { name: { $regex: /.*^A.*/ } } finds documents where the "name" field starts with the letter "A" (including variations like "Alice" or "Apple").  


==Logical Operators

    $and >> combines multiple conditions using $and , A document matches the query only if all of the specified conditions in the $and array are true.
        db.products.find({
            $and: [
                { price: { $gt: 20 } },  
                { category: "electronics" }  
            ]
        })
        This query finds products where the price is greater than 20 AND the category is "electronics".

    $or >> Combines multiples conditions using logical OR , A document match the query if atleast one of the specified conditions in the $or array is true. 
        db.users.find({
            $or: [
                { age: { $gt: 30 } },  
                { city: "New York" }  
            ]
        })
        This query finds users where either the age is greater than 30 OR the city is "New York".

    $not >> Inverts the logic of a single comparison expression.A document matches the query if the comparison following $not evaluates to false
        db.orders.find({
            $not: { status: "shipped" }  
        })
        This query finds orders where the status is not "shipped".

    $nor >> Combines multiple conditions using logical NOR. (Less commonly used).A document matches the query only if none of the specified conditions in the $nor array are true. (Think of it as the opposite of $and).
        db.books.find({
            $nor: [
                { category: "fiction" },  // NOT fiction
                { author: "John Doe" }  // NOT by John Doe
            ]
        })
        This query finds books that are neither categorized as fiction nor written by John Doe.

==Update operators 

    $set >> Updates the value of an existing field in a document.
        db.users.updateOne({ name: "Alice" }, { $set: { age: 31 } })
        // Updates the "age" field to 31 for the first document where "name" is "Alice".
    
    $unset >> Removes a field from a document.
        db.products.updateOne({ _id: productId }, { $unset: { discontinued: true } })
        // Removes the "discontinued" field from the product with the specified ID.

    $inc >> Increments (or decrements) the numerical value of a field.
        db.scores.updateOne({ studentId: 123 }, { $inc: { score: 5 } })
        // Increments the "score" field by 5 for the document with the specified studentId

    $rename >> Renames a field in a document.
        db.orders.updateOne({ _id: orderId }, { $rename: { "customerEmail": "contact" } })
        // Renames the "customerEmail" field to "contact" for the order with the specified ID.
   
    $addToSet >> Adds a unique value to an array field in a document. If the value already exists, it won't be added again.
        db.tasks.updateOne({ taskId: 1 }, { $addToSet: { tags: "important" } })
        // Adds the tag "important" to the "tags" array for the task with the specified ID, only if it doesn't exist already.


==Aggregation Pipeline Operators (not strictly update operators)

    sort() >> Sorts the results of an aggregation pipeline based on a specified field(s) in ascending or descending order.

    skip() >>  Skips a certain number of documents at the beginning of the results from an aggregation pipeline.

    limit() >>  Limits the number of documents returned in the results of an aggregation pipeline.

    example of above 3 operators:
        db.products.find({})
            .sort({ price: -1 })  // Sort by price (descending)
            .skip(5)               // Skip the first 5 documents
            .limit(10)              // Limit to the next 10 documents 


==upsert()

    upsert is a method that is used to insert and update the value in any operation.
    The mongoDB upsert method is a combination of insert and update.
    By default, the upset method's value is always false.

    If the document matches the specified query and the method's value is set to true, the update operation will update the matching documents.

    If the document does not match the specified query and the method value is true,this method inserts a new document in the collection. 
    
    This new document contains the fields that indicate the operation.


==upsert vs save

    If a document exists with the specified _id value, the save() method performs an update, replacing all fields in the existing record with the fields from the document.


==Array Update Operators

    $push >> Adds an element to an array.
    $pop >>  Removes the first or last element from an array.
    $pull >> Removes all instances of a value from an array.
    $pullAll >>  Removes all instances of specified values from an array.
    $ (Positional Operator) >> Used to update the first array element that matches a specified condition.
    $addToSet >> Adds an element to an array only if the element does not already exist in the array.
    

==Array query Operators

    $all >> Matches arrays that contain all elements specified in the query.
    $size >> Selects documents if the array field is a specified size.
    $elemMatch >> Matches documents that contain an array field with at least one element that matches all the specified query criteria.


==Field Existence Operator

    $exists >> Checks for the existence of a field in a document
    db.collection.find({ field: { $exists: true } })


==TTL index

    TTL stands for 'Time To Live" . 
    A TTL index is a special type of index in mongodb that automatically removes documents from a collection after a specified amount of time .

    example >>

    Session data: Store session information for a limited time and automatically invalidate expired sessions.

    Temporary data: Store temporary data that needs to be removed after a certain period.


==Redundancy

    Redundancy in mongodb is achieved primarily through replication. This means creating multiple copies of your data accross different database servers.  

    How it works>>>
        Replica set : A group of servers that maintain same data set through replication
        Primary Server : Receives all write operations and records changes in an oplog
        Secondary Servers : copy and apply changes from the oplog asynchrounously
        Automatically failover : If the Primary server fails, a secondary is automatically elected as the new primary.
    
    Benefits >>>
        High Availability : Ensures continous access to data even if a server fails.
        Disaster recovery : Protects against data loss due to hardware failures or other catastrophic events.  


==Replication

    Creates multiple copies of a complete dataset accross different servers (replica set)
    Focus on data redundancy and availability.


==Sharding

    Divides a large dataset into smaller subsets (shards) stored on different servers.
    Focus on Data distribution and scailability.

    shard key : : A field or combination of fields in your documents used to determine which shard will store a particular document
    Config servers : These servers store metadata about the sharded cluster, including the location of data and the configuration of shards.


==ACID( Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability )

    ACID is a set of properties that guarantee data integrity in a database.

    Atomicity = All operations within a transaction happen as a single unit. Either evrything completes successfully, or nothing changes.
    Consistency = The database always move fro one valid state to another.
    Isolation = Transactions operate independently. One transaction doesn't interfere with another.
    Durability = Once a transaction is complete , the changes are permenent  and wont be lost, even if there is a power outage or system failure.



==Journaling

    It is a mechanism in Mongodb that ensures data durability and recovery.It's like keeping a diary of all changes made to your database.

    Write operations = When you insert, update, or delete data, MongoDB first records these changes in a special log file called the journal.

    Committing changes = After a certain interval (configurable), MongoDB writes these changes to the main data files.

    Recovery = If MongoDB crashes before committing changes, the journal can be used to replay the unwritten changes to the data files, ensuring data consistency.



==CAP Theorem

    The CAP Theorem is a fundamental principle in distributed systems. it states that a distributed system can only guarantee two of the following three properties:

    Consistency = All nodes in the system see the same data at the same time.
    Availability = The system is always available and able to process requests.
    Partition Tolerence = The system continues to operate even if part of the system is unavailable.

    MongoDB prioritizes Availability and Partition Tolerence, making it an AP database.


==Election

    In a MongoDB replica set, the primary is the instance responsible for handling read and write operations. To ensure high availability and data durability, MongoDB employs a robust election process to choose a new primary when the current one fails or becomes unreachable.


==Transactions

    MongoDB transactions ensure data integrity and consistency by treating a group of operations as a single unit of work.
    This means either all operations within a transaction are completed successfully,or none of them are applied.



==MongoDB utilities

    MongoDB provides a set of tools to help you manage your database efficiently.

    mongoexport = Extracts data from a mongoDB collection and saves it as a JSON or CSV file.its like downloading data from your database.

    mongoimport = Loads data into a mongoDB collection from a JSON or CSV file. its like uploading data into your database.

    mongodumb = creates a backup of your entire database or specific collections in a binary format.

    mongorestore = restores a database or specific collections from a backup created by mongodumb

    mongostat = displays real-time statistics about your MongoDB servers performance.

    mongotop = shows the top databases, collections ,and operations based on current read and write activity.




==Normalization

    Breaking data into multiple collections with references for data integrity.

==Denormalization

    Combining data within documents for faster read performance



==Alias

    In MongoDB, an alias is a different name you can use for a field or variable in a query or aggregation. It lets you change the name of the field or variable in the results without changing the original data.

    example >>

        Assume you have a collection called users with documents like this:

            {
                "_id": 1,
                "firstName": "John",
                "lastName": "Doe",
                "age": 30
            }

        You can use an alias to rename the firstName field to name in the result:

            db.users.aggregate([
                {
                    $project: {
                        name: "$firstName",
                        lastName: 1,
                        age: 1
                    }
                }
            ])

        The result will look like this:

            {
            "_id": 1,
            "name": "John",
            "lastName": "Doe",
            "age": 30
            }





==GridFS

    Gridfs ia a specification for storing and retrieving larg files in mongoDB. it allows you to store files that exceed the BSON-document size limit of 16 MB.
    GridFS divides file into smaller chunks and stores each chunk as a separate document, making it possible to store and retrieve files of any size.



==IXSCAN
    Index Scan: MongoDB uses an index to efficiently locate documents matching the query criteria.


==COLLSCAN
    Collection Scan: MongoDB scans the entire collection to find matching documents.
